## nginx

[Nginx](https://www.nginx.org/)

nginx [engine x] is an HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy server, and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server, originally written by [Igor Sysoev](http://sysoev.ru/en/). For a long time, it has been running on many heavily loaded Russian sites including [Yandex](http://www.yandex.ru/), [Mail.Ru](http://mail.ru/), [VK](http://vk.com/), and [Rambler](http://www.rambler.ru/). According to Netcraft, nginx served or proxied [22.84% busiest sites in June 2021](https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2021/06/29/june-2021-web-server-survey.html). Here are some of the success stories: [Dropbox](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2017/09/optimizing-web-servers-for-high-throughput-and-low-latency/), [Netflix](https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/software/), [Wordpress.com](https://www.nginx.com/case-studies/nginx-wordpress-com/), [FastMail.FM](http://blog.fastmail.fm/2007/01/04/webimappop-frontend-proxies-changed-to-nginx/).
